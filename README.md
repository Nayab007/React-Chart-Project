# Frontend Mentor - Expenses chart component

![Design preview for the Expenses chart component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a decent understanding of HTML, CSS, and ReactJS Library.** I want to use ReactJs because I want to build something different instead of using just vanilla JS. I thought it would be good to make this page in REACTJS and use my style to make it a bit different. 

Here is the Link to the live webpage

## The challenge


We provide the data for the chart in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to dynamically add the bars if you choose.

Your users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different color to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.



## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommended hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.
